### Bugs

#### Fixed Bugs
   -   The button 'Join Now' in orange box in the main home page, when rotating small/medium devices to landscape view,
  would be pushed out of the box downwards.
   -   The bug happened for the height being based on the height view, instead 'height: auto;' sorted the bug.
   -   The imagens was strach and to fix it I used the object-fit:cover; and now the images is pretty good
    
   - Before

   ![Screenshot_20230228_144040](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96267170/221886900-e984d141-d4cf-443a-9410-09b6ce0599bf.png)

   - after fix bug

   ![Screenshot_20230228_144233](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96267170/221887326-f69ac27a-a653-4a09-88a3-c48234e38059.png)
   
   Images not accurate due to copyright purposes. Because I needed to change images that were taken from google before to new images taken from Unsplash.

   -   Navigation menu doesn't collapse when clicking on links, tried few differents methods unsuccessfully, I ask my mentor for help and she helped me showing a JavaScript code to fix it.
   
   -   When I would click on send button it made an error beacuse I was using the method="post" so I took it out and put a link to thank you page.
   
   -   When I started coding I was using Gitpod and I used git push to push it to my repository and I thought it worked but when I turned off my computer and turned on again I didn't find it on my github, so I lost it all and I start using VsCode and GitHub Desktop to push it to my repository since.

### GitHub Pages

The project was deployed to GitHub Pages using the following steps:

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/bernardellimyckael/Milestone-Project)
2. At the top of the Repository (not top of page), locate the "Settings" Button on the menu.
    - Alternatively Click [Here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/) for a GIF demonstrating the process starting from Step 2.
3. Scroll down the Settings page until you locate the "GitHub Pages" Section.
4. Under "Source", click the dropdown called "None" and select "Master Branch".
5. The page will automatically refresh.
6. Scroll back down through the page to locate the now published site [link](https://bernardellimyckael.github.io/Milestone-Project/) in the "GitHub Pages" section.
